### Multi-phase or multi-PR plan

**You own the plan, not the code. The plan is a checklist an owner runs box by box and the operator audits from the evidence.** The plan is the deliverable. Do not implement.

1. When the change is one or two files with an obvious approach, skip the plan. Say so and stop.
2. Settle open questions by prototype before you write. Run `playbooks/prototype.md` for each. Keep the branch, the SHA, and the screenshots for Appendix A. Ask the operator only about a product or preference call that no run can settle. Give options (**Never Block on the Human**).
3. Explore in subagents that read this skill first, with an explicit model per the Subagents section (**Guard the Context Window**). Pick each subagent's model and reasoning level for the job, per the Subagents section. Each returns file pointers, conventions, test commands, and entry points. No inlined dumps.
4. Copy the skeleton below into the plan file and fill every placeholder. Unless the operator names a path, write the file to `docs/plans/<program-slug>.md` in the repo. Keep every heading and every sub-block in the order shown. One section per PR. One PR is one change with its own evidence (**Sequence Work into Verifiable Units**). Name the execution playbook in **How to read this**: usually Autonomous run (`playbooks/autonomous-run.md`), with each PR built under Feature, Refactoring, or Bug fix.
5. Write under the **technical-writing** skill in full, then the **unslop** skill. The body is one Diátaxis mode, how-to. Appendices hold explanation and reference. Each heading states the task or the finding. No long dashes. No mid-sentence colons.
6. Check the plan mechanically before handing it back (**Encode Lessons in Structure**). No `<placeholder>` survives (`grep -n '<[A-Za-z][^>]*>' <plan.md>` finds none outside code). Every PR section has all nine sub-blocks in order. Every verification block opens with the verification rule. Fix every gap.
7. Hand back. Post the plan path and the check results, then stop. Execution starts on the operator's explicit go, under the execution playbook the plan names.

**Verification.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked (**Prove It Works**). That sentence is the verification rule. Every verification block opens with it. The live block is mandatory. Live lanes at the PR head drive the real surface through the repo's verification skill, each run by a subagent that did not write the code, in parallel. Use as many lanes as the behavior needs, usually three to ten. Each lane is one box with a concrete scenario, the screenshot it saves, and its pass predicate. One lane is the **Regression lane against trunk.** It runs the same load-bearing scenario on trunk and head. If trunk does not have the feature, the lane records that fact and gates the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for instead of inventing a trunk result. The perf gate is dual-sided. Trunk and head must both produce the named metric. If trunk lacks the feature, also isolate the work the diff adds and set an absolute budget for that work plus the end-to-end state the user waits for. Do not claim a ratio between unlike scenarios. The perf block names the metric, the interleaved probe, the trunk baseline measured first, and the rule with the number that fails. A PR that changes an interaction is review-gated. The operator reviews it in chat with screenshots and a video before merge. A PR that changes no interaction writes `**Review gate.** None. <PR id> is not review-gated.` and no boxes under it.

**Verification skill.** Use the repo's `verify-<app>` skill, created with the **create-verification-skill** skill if it is missing. It names how to drive each surface: a browser for web and Electron UIs, a PTY or tmux session for CLIs and TUIs, a simulator for native mobile. A PR that touches two surfaces gets lanes on both. A surface with no driver is a risk in Appendix C, and its live block still names how each lane drives it.

# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a screenshot, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program runs the caidan-mode `<execution playbook>` playbook. <Who merges, and which PR ids are the operator's items that stop at merge-ready.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol and this plan to the operator, then stop. Start execution only on the operator's explicit go.
- [ ] Read these at program start. Re-read them at every tick.
  - [ ] The caidan-mode `<execution playbook>` playbook.
  - [ ] The caidan-mode Opening a PR playbook.
  - [ ] `<verification skill path>`
  - [ ] `<each other skill the program uses>`
- [ ] On the operator's go, arm an hourly audit tick with the tick prompt below, using your harness's scheduler or a timed recheck. Never leave the cadence to memory.
- [ ] Use this tick prompt, verbatim. "Re-read the execution playbook from trunk. Audit the operation against it and fix drift in this tick. Probe every active lane and judge progress by side effects only. Stand down a stuck lane and dispatch its replacement now. Then post a short status message to the operator in chat only when the audit found a tracked change that no earlier status message reported, such as a PR opened, a code-ready head, a round launched or closed, a verdict, a merge, a stuck agent and the action taken, a blocker added or cleared, or a decision only the operator can make. Name every such change and nothing else. Do not repeat a table, the merged list, or an unchanged blocker. If the audit found none, end the turn with no reply text. Either way, log this tick's row in your decision trail. The row names the items reported, or none."
- [ ] On the operator's hold or stand-down, send every owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Spawn owners

- [ ] Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its parent merges, or base it on the parent branch when the execution playbook stacks.
  - [ ] <PR id> and <PR id> are independent and first. Both branch from `main`.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change an interaction. They wait for the operator's review in chat with screenshots and a video before merge.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Use `gh` for every PR operation.
- [ ] Open the PR ready, never draft, per **Opening a PR**. Use the run's built-in PR tool when it has one, else `gh pr create --base <base-branch>`. A stack child targets its parent branch.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run the **simplify** skill before each commit and the **code-comments** skill before review.
- [ ] Triage every review-bot and security-scanner comment per the caidan-mode `references/review-bot-triage.md`.
- [ ] Rebase onto current trunk before the code-ready report and babysit. Keep that merge base in fix rounds. Rebase again only at merge prep, on a `git merge-tree` conflict with trunk, or on a CI failure that comes from a change on trunk.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] A full verification fan-out runs once, at the code-ready head: parallel subagents that did not write the code. Another full fan-out runs only for new behavior, a redesign, or a large new diff. A rebase, a merge-conflict resolution, or a minor fix gets a single verifier at the new head. One gates lane. The live lanes from the PR's **Verify, live** block. The perf lane from its **Verify, perf** block. Two or more audit lanes, each with its own focus, that read the diff and the receipts and distrust the PR body. The root audits the receipts in the merge-ready report before the verdict.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner, including a defect that a lane filed as a note. A new head gets a fresh verdict, except for results that stay valid under the patch-id rule in `playbooks/shipping.md`.
- [ ] <The merge or append rule from the execution playbook, with the patch-id rule from `playbooks/shipping.md`.>

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane runs in its own worktree or machine at the PR head, so lanes never share a running instance. Drive through the repo's verification skill.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Start the backend and the surface. Wait for ready.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the repo's verification skill's commands. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save every screenshot to `/tmp/verify-<pr-id>/lane-<n>/<slug>.png` and return the paths with the report.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked. <N> lanes at the PR head, per the boot recipe.

- [ ] Lane 1. Regression lane against trunk. Run <the same load-bearing scenario> at trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, record that and gate <the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for>. Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 3. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane <n>. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>. One box per remaining lane.

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured at both trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, also name the diff-added work and the end-to-end state the user waits for.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved. Both sides must produce the metric.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails. If the scenarios differ, add absolute budgets for the diff-added work and the user-visible end state instead of an invalid ratio.>

**Review gate.** The operator reviews before merge.

- [ ] Copy lane <n> screenshots into `<media path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>.png`.
- [ ] Record a 30 to 60 second video of the change in a lane's instance. Save it as `<media path>/<pr-id>-review.mp4`.
- [ ] Post the screenshots and the video in chat. Stop at merge-ready. Wait for the operator's click.

**Merge.**

- [ ] Root's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] Review-bot triage done.
- [ ] Rebased onto current trunk after the verdict, patch-id unchanged.
- [ ] <The owner squash-merges its own PR, or the root appends it to the base-branch stack and the operator lands it bottom-up.>

## Close the program

- [ ] Every box above is checked with its evidence.
